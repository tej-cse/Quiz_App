# 🎯 **QuizApp**

**QuizApp** is a ReactJS-based web application that allows users to take assessments by solving multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The application ensures a seamless user experience with validations, scoring, and a final result display.

## 🚀 **How It Works**

1. **Start the Quiz**:  
   - The quiz begins with the first question displayed on the screen.  

2. **Option Selection**:  
   - Users must select an option to enable the "Next" button.  
   - If no option is selected, the user cannot proceed to the next question.  

3. **Score Calculation**:  
   - The score is updated dynamically based on the correctness of the selected options.  

4. **Final Score**:  
   - Once the user completes all questions, the application displays the final score out of the total number of questions.
